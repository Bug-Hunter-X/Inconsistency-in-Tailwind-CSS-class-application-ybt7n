# Tailwind CSS Inconsistency Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered while using Tailwind CSS. The issue involves unpredictable behavior when applying a combination of Tailwind utility classes, particularly within complex layouts.

The `bug.js` file contains the code snippet that reproduces the problem, while `bugSolution.js` presents a possible solution and strategies to mitigate this issue. Note that the solution may vary depending on the specific context of your application.  The bug is not always consistent in reproduction, but the example demonstrates scenarios where unexpected behavior can occur. This is not a bug within Tailwind itself, but a potential conflict or unexpected behavior when using a wide variety of classes.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and run the code.
3. Observe the unexpected rendering. The specific visual behavior may differ depending on your setup.

## Solutions and Mitigation

Refer to `bugSolution.js` for suggested approaches. This involves careful scrutiny of Tailwind's class order and potentially adding more specific classes to override unintended styles.
